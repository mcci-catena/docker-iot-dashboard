## Notes

Throughout this document, we use `dashboard.example.com` as the DNS name for the server. You will, of course, change this to something more suitable. When you do this, other things are to be named consistently:

- `/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com` is the directory (on the host system) containing the docker files.

- `/var/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com` is the directory (on the host system) containing persistent data.

Node-RED familiarity is assumed.

## Cloud-Provider-Specific Setup

As an initial step, a cloud provider is required and Docker and Docker-Compose must be installed. The procedure is provider dependent.

### On Digital Ocean

#### Create droplet

1. Log in to [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/)

2. Create a new project (if needed) to hold the new droplet.

3. Discover > Marketplace, search for `Docker`

4. This page will be redirected:
    <https://cloud.digitalocean.com/marketplace/5ba19751fc53b8179c7a0071?i=ec3581>

5. Press "Create"

6. Select the standard 8G GB Starter that is selected.

7. Choose a datacenter; *New York is selected in the example created for this document.*

8. Additional options: none.

9. Add the SSH keys.

10. Choose a host name, *e.g. `passivehouse-ecovillage`.*

11. Select the project.

12. Press "Create"

#### Configure droplet

1. Note the IP address from above.

2. `ssh root@{ipaddress}`

3. Remove the motd (message of the day).

4. Add user(s). Change `username` as needed.

   ```bash
    adduser username
    adduser username admin
    adduser username docker
    adduser username plugdev
    adduser username staff
   ```

5. Disable root login via SSH or via password

6. Optional: enable `username` to sudo without password.

   ```bash
   sudo VISUAL=vi visudo
   ```

   Add the following line at the bottom:

   ```bash
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

7. Test that you can become `username`:

   ```console
   # sudo su - username
   username@host-name:~$
   ```

8. Drop back to root, and then copy the authorized_keys file to   `~username`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -m 700 ~username/.ssh
   cp -p .ssh/authorized_keys ~username/.ssh
   chown -R username.username ~username/.ssh
   ```

9. Confirm that the user can SSH in.

10. Optional: set up byobu by default. This allows a session to continue even if your connection drops.

    ```bash
    byobu
    byobu-enable
    ```

11. Set the host name.

    ```bash
    vi /etc/hosts
    ```

    Change the line `127.0.1.1 name name` to `127.0.0.1 dashboard.myfq.dn dashboard`.

12. If needed, use `hostnamectl` to set the static hostname to match `dashboard`.

13. Set up git. This makes sure you have the latest version.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    ```

14. We'll put the docker files at `/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com`, setting up as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /opt/docker
    cd /opt/docker
    sudo chgrp admin .
    sudo chmod g+w .
    ```

## List of required ports to be opened in the firewall

Remember, if the server is running on a cloud platform like Microsoft Azure or AWS, one needs to check the firewall and confirm that the below ports are open to the outside world.

- 80/tcp
- 443/tcp
- 8883/tcp
- 8083/tcp
- 1883/tcp (if needed; not secure)

## After server is set up

The following instructions are essentially independent of the cloud provider and the underlying distribution. But this was only tested on Ubuntu and (in 2019) on CentOS.

1. Clone this repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mcci-catena/docker-iot-dashboard.git /opt/docker/dashboard.example.com
    ```

2. Move to the directory populated in step 1.

    ```bash
    cd /opt/docker/dashboard.example.com
    ```

3. Get a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) for the server, for which the DNS can be controlled. Point it to the server. Make sure it works, using "`dig FQDN`" -- get back an `A` record pointing to your server's IP address.

### Create a data directory for your server

We recommend that the directory be named `/var/docker/dashboard.example.com`; but it can be anything. You'll need the name below. Here's a sample for creating it:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/docker
sudo mkdir /var/docker/dashboard.example.com
```

Note, therefore, that the _code_ for your dashboard lives at `/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com`. The _data_ for your dashboard lives at `/var/docker/dashboard.example.com`.

### Create and edit the .env file

First, create a .env file. The following comand sequence can be cut and paste to generate an empty template:

```bash
sed -ne '/^#+++/,/^#---/p' docker-compose.yml | sed -e '/^#[^ \t]/d' -e '/^# IOT/s/$/=/' > .env
```

Then, edit the .env file as follows:

1. `IOT_DASHBOARD_NGINX_FQDN=dashboard.example.com`

    This sets the name of the resulting server. It tells Nginx what it's serving out. It must be a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that resolves to the IP address of the container host.

2. `IOT_DASHBOARD_CERTBOT_FQDN=dashboard.example.com`

    This should be the same as `IOT_DASHBOARD_NGINX_FQDN`.

3. `IOT_DASHBOARD_CERTBOT_EMAIL=someone@example.com`

    This sets the contact email for Let's Encrypt. The script automatically accepts the Let's Encrypt terms of service, and this indicates who is doing the accepting.

4. `IOT_DASHBOARD_DATA=/full/path/to/directory/`

    The trailing slash is required! This will put all the data files for this instance as subdirectories of the specified path. If this is undefined, `docker-compose` will print error messages and quit.

5. `IOT_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=SomethingVerySecretIndeed`

    This needs to be confidential. Indeed this sets the *initial* password for the Grafana admin login.This should be changed via the Grafana UI after booting the server.

6. `IOT_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`

    This sets the Grafana originating mail address.

7. `IOT_DASHBOARD_GRAFANA_INSTALL_PLUGINS=plugin plugin2`

    This sets a list of Grafana plugins to install.

8. `IOT_DASHBOARD_INFLUXDB_INITIAL_DATABASE_NAME=demo`

    Change "demo" to the desired name of the initial database that will be created in InfluxDB.

9. `IOT_DASHBOARD_MAIL_HOST_NAME=dashboard.example.com`

    This sets the name of your mail server. Used by Postfix.

10. `IOT_DASHBOARD_MAIL_DOMAIN=example.com`

    This sets the domain name of your mail server. Used by Postfix.

11. `IOT_DASHBOARD_NODERED_INSTALL_PLUGINS=node-red-node-example1 node-red-node-example2`

    This installs one or more Node-RED plug-ins.

12. `IOT_DASHBOARD_TIMEZONE=Europe/Paris`

    If not defined, the default time zone will be GMT.

13. `IOT_DASHBOARD_INFLUXDB_MAIL_HOST_NAME=dashboard.example.com`

    This sets the name of your mail server for backup mail. Used by Postfix.

14. `IOT_DASHBOARD_INFLUXDB_BACKUP_EMAIL=a@example.com b@example.com`

    Backup mail will be sent to the mentioned MAIL IDs.

The resulting `.env` file should look like this:

```bash

```

### Set up the Node-RED and InfluxDB API logins

Run the following commands.

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose build
```

If there are any errors, they need to be fixed before going on.

#### Migrating `htpasswd` from Apache to Nginx (if required)

If migrating from an older version of the dashboard that used Apache, you'll need to migrate the `htpasswd` file.

- Copy [`htpasswd_migration.sh`](./htpasswd_migration.sh) into your local directory (on the host system) containing the docker files.

- Run the script as below.

    ```bash
    chmod +x htpasswd_migration.sh
    ./htpasswd_migration.sh
    ```

- This script creates one `htpasswd` for each of the controlled services, and then copies them(`node-red_htpasswd`, `query_htpasswd`) to appropriate files as below.

  - For Node-red:
    `${IOT_DASHBOARD_DATA}docker-nginx/authdata/nodered/.htpasswd`

  - For Infludb Queries:
    `${IOT_DASHBOARD_DATA}docker-nginx/authdata/influxdb/.htpasswd`

- If you are migrating older `htpasswd` files, please skip steps `[1-4]` to `htpasswd` below.

#### Creating new `htpasswd` files

1. Log into the Nginx docker container.

    ```console
    $ docker-compose run nginx /bin/bash
    #
    ```

   If this fails with the message, `ERROR: Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localunixsocket - is it running?`, then probably the user ID is not in the `docker` group. To fix this, `sudo adduser MYUSER docker`, where "MYUSER" is the login ID. Then (**very important**) log out and log back in.

2. Create `.htpasswd` files for node-red and influxdb queries authentication.

    ```bash
    touch /etc/nginx/authdata/influxdb/.htpasswd
    touch /etc/nginx/authdata/nodered/.htpasswd
    chown www-data /etc/nginx/authdata/influxdb/.htpasswd
    chown www-data /etc/nginx/authdata/nodered/.htpasswd
    ```

3. Add user logins for node-red and influxdb queries. Make `USERS` be a list of login IDs.

   - For Node-red authentication:

       ```bash
       export USERS="tmm amy josh"
       for USER in $USERS; do \
        echo "Set password for "$USER; \
        htpasswd /etc/nginx/authdata/nodered/.htpasswd $USER; \
       done
       ```

   - For Influxdb queries:

       ```bash
       export USERS="tmm amy josh"
       for USER in $USERS; do \
        echo "Set password for "$USER; \
        htpasswd /etc/nginx/authdata/influxdb/.htpasswd $USER; \
       done
       ```

4. Exit Nginx's container with Control+D.

#### Set up the `MQTTs` User Credentials

To access mqtt channel, user needs credentials to access it.

1. Log into the mqtts docker container.

   ```console
   $ docker-compose run mqtts /bin/bash
   #
   ```

2. In the container, Create username and password using `mosquitto_passwd` command. ( option `-c` - Create a new password file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. so `-c` should be used for the first user creation. please avoid `-c` for the second user creation onwards. )

   ```bash
   # mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/credentials/passwd <user>
   Password:
   Reenter password:
   ```

3. Close the connection to mqtts (Ctrl+D).

### Start the server

1. Starting things up in "interactive mode" is recommended as a first step.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

This will show the log output from the various services. It will also be pretty clear if there are any issues.

One common error (for me, anyway) is entering an illegal initial InfluxDB database name. InfluxDB will spew a number of errors, but eventually it will start up anyway. But then the database needs to be created manually.

### Restart servers in the background

Once the servers are coming up interactively, use ^C to shut them down, and then restart in daemon mode.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Status of the containers can be seen as below

```console
$ docker-compose ps

               Name                             Command                  State                           Ports
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dashboard.example.com_cron-backup_1   /sbin/my_init                    Up
dashboard.example.com_grafana_1       /run.sh                          Up                                3000/tcp
dashboard.example.com_influxdb_1      /sbin/my_init                    Up                                8086/tcp
dashboard.example.com_mqtts_1         /sbin/my_init                    Up                                0.0.0.0:8083->8083/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8883->8883/tcp
dashboard.example.com_nginx_1         /sbin/my_init                    Up                                0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
dashboard.example.com_node-red_1      npm --no-update-notifier - ...   Up (healthy)                      1880/tcp
dashboard.example.com_postfix_1       /sbin/my_init                    Up                                25/tcp

```

### Initial testing

- Open Grafana on [https://dashboard.example.com](https://dashboard.example.com/), and log in as admin.

- Change the admin password.

### Set up first data source

Use the Grafana UI -- either click on "add first data source" or use "Configure >Add Data Source", and add an InfluxDB data source.

- Set the URL (under HTTP Settings) to `<http://influxdb:8086>`.

- Select the database. If InfluxDB is properly initialized in a database, connect to it as a Grafana data source. If not, [create an InfluxDB database](https://github.com/mcci-catena/docker-iot-dashboard/blob/master/SETUP.md#creating-an-influxdb-database).

- Leave user and password blank.

- Click "Save & Test".

### Test Node-RED

Open Node-RED on <https://dashboard.example.com/node-red/>, and build a flow that stores data in InfluxDB. **Be sure to add the trailing slash! Otherwise a 404 error pops from Grafana. This will be fixed soon.**

### Creating an InfluxDB database

To create a database, log in to the host machine, and cd to `/opt/docker/dashboard.example.com`. Use the following commands:

```console
$ docker-compose exec influxdb /bin/bash
# influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.6
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.6
Enter an InfluxQL query
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
_internal
> create database "my-new-database"
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
_internal
my-new-database
> ^D
# ^D
$
```

- Testing Mail setup on `Influxdb` and `Postfix`

    Mail setup on `Influxdb` and `Postfix` can be tested using `mail` command, by logging into their container.

    ***Influxdb***
    1. Log into the `Influxdb` docker container

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec influxdb bash

    root@influxdbbackup:/# mail -s "Testing mail from Influxdb" cmurugan@mcci.com
    Cc:
    Testing1
    ```

    ***Postfix***

    1. Log into the `Postfix` docker container

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec postfix bash

    root@dashboard:/# mail -s "Testing mail from Postfix" cmurugan@mcci.com
    Cc:
    Testing1
    ```

- Testing Mail setup on Node-red

    Mail setup on Node-red can be tested by deploying a node-red flow on <https://dashboard.example.com/node-red/> as shown below.

    ![nodered_mail_testing](assets/postfix_node_1.png)

    ***Inject node's configuration***

    ![nodered_mail_testing](assets/postfix_node_2.png)

    here,
  - `msg.payload` will be act as `mail body`.
  - `msg.topic`will be act as `subject`.
  - `msg.from` will be act as `Sender`

   ***Email node's configuration***

    ![nodered_mail_testing](assets/postfix_node_3.png)

### Test MQTT Channels

- To test the `MQTT over TCP` and `MQTT over TLS/SSL` channels user can use [mosquitto client](https://mosquitto.org/download/) tool.

  - MQTT over TCP

      `Subscribing` mqtt channel on topic `test`

      ```bash
      mosquitto_sub -h dashboard.example.com -t test -p 1883 -u user1 -P pwd123
      
      hello
      ```

      `publishing` on mqtt channel with topic `test`

      ```bash
      mosquitto_pub -h dashboard.example.com -m "hello" -t test -p 1883 -u user1 -P pwd123
